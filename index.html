        <h1>Lucas's Research Page!</h1>

        <p class = "intro">Welcome - I'm Lucas! I'm currently an atmospheric science PhD student in the 
        Cloud Physics Group at the University of California Davis. As a student, I've always been interested
        in learning about who my instructors and collegues really are as people. This webpage is meant to
        serve as a resource for anyone who has that same inquiry about me. While I've included details about my
        research, my hope is that this page can help you get a better understanding of my story 
        and who I am as a person. I'm always excited to meet new people both in and outside of academia, 
        so I do sincerely hope you reach out! I'd love to chat!
