        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Page!</h1>
        <p>Hello - I'm Lucas! I'm currently an atmospheric science PhD student at the University of California Davis.
        I'm originally from Houston, TX and graduated from Clear Falls High School (go Knights!) in 2022.
        After highschool, I attended Long Island University - Post (go Sharks!) where I played NCAA D1 tennis
        and pursued a dual-degree in mathematics and computer science. I had originally planned to pursue a career in electrical
        engineering (following in my father's footsteps), but after spending a summer volunteering for the Student Conservation Assocation
        in the backcountry wilderness of Washington state, I knew I wanted to be an Earth scientist. From there, I interned for two summers
        in the Cloud Processes Group at Brookhaven National Laboratory, fell in love with cloud physics, and the rest is history!
        Now, my research is focused on using high-resolution numerical models to develop advanced cloud microphysics parameterizations 
        and improve our theoretical understanding of cloud microphysics processes. <br>
            
        Outside of academics and research, I a most likely playing tennis (albeit far less competetively), spending time in the outdoors, 
        strumming my guitar, seeing films in the theater, or embracing my German heritage (meist mit Bier).<br>
        
        It is my goal to enter academia and become a professor, so I am always looking for new opportunities to improve my
        teaching and presentation skills and mentor students. I'm happy to collaborate with current undergraduate students
        and help you realize that you also want to be a cloud physicist!
