    <p class = "intro">Welcome - I'm Lucas! I'm currently an atmospheric science PhD student at the University of California Davis.
        I'm originally from Houston, TX and graduated from Clear Falls High School (go Knights!) in 2022.
        After highschool, I attended Long Island University - Post (go Sharks!) where I played NCAA D1 tennis
        and pursued a dual-degree in mathematics and computer science. I had originally planned to pursue a career in electrical
        engineering (following in my father's footsteps), but after spending a summer volunteering for the Student Conservation Assocation
        in the backcountry wilderness of Washington state, I knew I wanted to be an Earth scientist. From there, I interned for two summers
        in the Cloud Processes Group at Brookhaven National Laboratory, fell in love with cloud physics, and the rest is history!
