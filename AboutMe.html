            <h2>Early Life in Houston</h2>
            <p>I had a pretty normal childhood in Seabrook, Texas - a small surburb Southeast of Houston.
                 I was, however, very lucky to live just under 2 miles away from NASA Johnson Space Center and was
                exposed to space science and engineering at a very young age. As a kid, I always anticapited that
                I would eventually end up in the aerospace engineering, but my plans would take a shift once I started high school.
                <br><br>
                During my freshman year, I began playing tennis for the high school team and quickly fell in love with the sport.
                Over the next four years, I dedicated the majority of my time to improving my game and traveling across Texas
                to compete. This hardwork paid off, and during the spring of my senior year, I accepted my recruitment offer
                to play Division I tennis for the Long Island University Sharks.</p>

            <h2>Finding My Passion</h2>
            <p>I entered college with the full intentions of pursuing a career in tennis
                , but after playing my first season of Division I tennis and
                 working part-time at the John McEnroe, I realized that I was not meant to spend
                 the rest of my life on the tennis court. However, this begged the question - what
                 should I do now? After taking some time to think, I came to the logical conclusion to
                 move across the country and join a trail crew in the backcountry wilderness (Shoutout to
                 the <a href="https://thesca.org/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Conservation Association</a>).
                 Working alongside a ragtag group of trailbuilders, I fostered a deeper
                  appreciation of our planet and knew that I had found my passion in Earth Science.

            <h2>Getting Cloudy</h2>
            <p>After returning from my summer stint with the forest service, I was motivated to find a way to combine my love for Earth
                with my educational background of mathematics and computer science. Over the next fall I considered and applied
                to a large number of internship programs from virtually all disciplines of Earth Science; however, when I connected
                with Dr. Yangang Liu, a cloud physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, I knew what I wanted to pursue.
                Joining Dr. Liu's group over the summer, I became hooked on cloud physics and fell in love with the thrill
                of using computational models to learn more about cloud processes. <br><br>
                
                As I learned more about the field and came to
                understand how important clouds are in the global Earth system, I knew that I had found my calling. Since then,
                I have worked to build my cloud physics knowledge base and skill set with hopes of becoming a university professor
                to tackle pressing challenges in the cloud physics community and help foster a love for our planet in the next 
                generation of students.
